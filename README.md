# Better Durability

* A mod to prevent your precious tools from breaking!

# Notice

* This mod is for **Forge** only.
* This mod doesn't yet support shields and armor but will do in a future release.

# What does this mod do?

* When the tool you are using reaches **critical durability** (break on next use), it will render as **Broken** and you
  will not be able to use it until you repair it.
* As of now only Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes, Hoes, Bows, Crossbows, Tridents, Fishing Rods, Shears and Flint and
  Steel are supported.
